title: v1.2.0

### Breaking Changes

* New decorator signature: Single exceptions or multiple exceptions in an array now have to be passed with an arrow function. ([Issue #1](https://github.com/nanogiants/nestjs-swagger-api-exception-decorator/issues/1))
  * Example: `@ApiException(() => BadRequestException)`
  * **The old signature without an arrow function is now deprecated and will be removed in future versions**
  * Using the old signature with the `@TemplatedApiException`-decorator will be detected and a warning including the class and method names will be printed to the console

### New Features

* Exceptions for multiple status codes may now be passed within a single decorator call ([Issue #13](https://github.com/nanogiants/nestjs-swagger-api-exception-decorator/issues/13))
  * Example: `@TemplatedApiException(() => [UserNotFoundException, InvalidPasswordException])`
  * No warnings are printed anymore and the grouping now works properly
* New option properties ([see new API description](/api)) ([Issue #1](https://github.com/nanogiants/nestjs-swagger-api-exception-decorator/issues/1))
  * `type`
  * `schema`
  * `isArray`

### Fixed Issues

* `null` as template value caused an error
